							<h2><strong>Pure Hemp&nbsp;Botanicals&nbsp;</strong></h2>
							<h3><strong>Compassion in Action &#8211; <em>Through a Passion for Hemp</em></strong></h3>
							<h3><strong><br>
							Mission and Business Practices:</strong></h3>
							<p>At Pure Hemp Botanicals, our mantra, “Compassion in Action,” guides our work and relationships. We serve a growing community of evolving hearts and minds to produce sustainable, plant-based, vegan, and cruelty free products.&nbsp; We seek to raise awareness and inspire others to adopt an attitude of compassion for people and the planet. Our commitment to compassion is solidly demonstrated in every aspect of our organization and its practices.</p>
							<h4><strong><u>Compassion for the Planet&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
							<p>Our planet, our home, is constantly under siege due to climate change, destruction of habitat and natural resources, pollution, pesticides and more. As awareness of these issues grows, many global citizens and consumers have chosen to say “no more” by refusing to buy products or do business with companies whose activities carelessly waste resources or abuse our Mother Earth. That’s one reason we have a passion for hemp and have chosen it as the foundation of our product line. Hemp and other plant-based goods deplete fewer resources and create less waste during production than animal-based products.&nbsp;This makes plant-based production a more compassionate method for the earth and our animal friends.&nbsp; Hemp is versatile in its applications, serving as a source for a variety of items including providing an alternative for items typically made from non-sustainable resources. Pure Hemp Botanicals promises to consider our planet first in the creation of its products, use of packaging, and in the footprint resulting from its operations. &nbsp;We respect all the earth’s inhabitants by sourcing only cruelty free and plant-based ingredients.</p>
							<h4><strong><u>Compassion for the Planet’s Inhabitants&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
							<p>Our commitment to “Compassion in Action” prescribes an appreciation and respect for all species, especially our fellow human beings. We embrace diversity, celebrate individuality, value human dignity, and advocate a spirit of cooperation through which we may wash away counter-productive conflict. Pure Hemp Botanicals products are never sourced from or tested on animals. Our practices ensure employment standards that are respectful of those who provide labor to bring our customers options that nourish and sustain the inhabitants of our planet.</p>
							<h4><strong><u>Compassion for our Employees&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
							<p>Our employees are our heart and the life blood of our organization.&nbsp; We acknowledge that every position in our company is vital to a quality operation and appreciate the participation of each employee towards that goal. We promise to put compassion above profit and communication above productivity in our intracompany relationships.</p>
							<h4><strong><u>Compassion through Plants</u></strong></h4>
							<p>Although hemp and marijuana are both members of the Cannabis genus of plants, they are very different in their properties and the benefits they offer. Species of Cannabis plants have been referred to as the “ultimate plants of compassion” and for centuries have been highly regarded as sources for diverse products from medicines to fibers. Hemp cannabis plants perfectly portray a plant of compassion that when used world-wide will provide a multitude of benefits to human health and daily living.&nbsp; Pure Hemp Botanicals pledges to use only organically grown (no pesticides or herbicides), industrial hemp plant material and therefore optimize the purity and effectiveness of the products we provide to our community of customers. We ensure that our manufacturing partners follow our strict guidelines as well.

							<h4><strong><u>Compassion through Service</u></strong></h4>
							<p>Pure Hemp Botanicals believes we each have a personal role in creating the world that we envision through service in both our local communities and globally. We encourage our employees to participate in service events and, as representatives of the company, to incorporate a mindset of service to customers into every action they perform. We also contribute monetary donations to charities whose work we believe has a meaningful and positive impact in our world. Visit <a href="../../phb-gives-back/index.html">https://purehempbotanicals.com/phb-gives-back/</a> to learn more about organizations we support.<br>
							Our service also extends to those who are in the most immediate and urgent need for our products.&nbsp; For that reason we have created the PHB Care Club.&nbsp; The PHB Care Club provides those customers with daily needs of our products to receive as much as 50% off our Retail prices.</p>
							<p>To sum it up, we’re all about bringing you amazing, organically grown, hemp-based products that we know you will love! We’re passionate about ensuring that the entire process is one of quality that is grounded in compassion for the earth and its inhabitants. That’s what makes us unique and why you’ll love being part of the Pure Hemp Botanicals community!</p>
