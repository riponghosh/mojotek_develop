														<h3>What are your Hours of Operation?</h3>

														<h3>Do you ship out of state?</h3>
														<ol>
															<li style="padding-left: 30px;">In 2014, the Farm Bill Sec 7606 allows us to legally produce our hemp which has been tested by the Department of Agriculture to have less than 0.3% THC. The Omnibus Bill defunds the Department of Justice from stopping transit of a hemp product which is protected by the Farm Bill Sec 7606. If you are having an issue with a receiving a package please contact our customer service representatives either by phone at 1-844-443-6764 or email at <a href="mailto:customerservice@purehempbotanicals.com">customerservice@purehempbotanicals.com</a>
															</li>
															<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Hemp oil, dietary hempseeds, and other hemp products are legal in all 50 states, but it is not legal to grow hemp in most states. Even though marijuana and hemp are two different plants, the federal government considers&nbsp;all&nbsp;cannabis plants a&nbsp;<a href="../4-reasons-why-hemp-should-not-be-considered-a-schedule-1-substance/index.html">Schedule 1 Substance</a>. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.votehemp.com/legislation.html">Vote Hemp</a>, only fifteen states— Colorado, California, Oregon, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah, Kentucky, Indiana, South Carolina, Delaware, Vermont, Maine, West Virginia and Hawaii—allow industrial hemp farming for commercial purposes and/or research.&nbsp;This might change if the government passes the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015. If you think that it should be legal to grow hemp in all 50 states, please let your senators and congressmen know by signing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-take-action-to-support-u-s-farmer-and-consumer-rights?just_created=true">our petition on Change.org</a>.

														<h3>Is CBD legal in my State?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">States hold their own laws regarding Hemp / CBD and the use of CBD products. We recommend that you check your state laws prior to purchasing.</p>
														<h3>Can I fail a drug test with the use of PHB Products?</h3>
														<ol>
															<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Our products are manufactured using hemp extract, defined by the Colorado Department of Agriculture as &#8220;a plant of the genus Cannabis and any part of the plant, whether growing or not, containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) concentration of no more than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) on a dry weight basis.”</li>
															<li style="padding-left: 30px;">In simple terms, all our products may contain up to 0.3% THC. The THC amount in mg will vary depending on product suggested dosage therefore there is a possibility that consumption of the product could possibly trigger a positive test. Many drug screens tests for THC, which is the psychoactive compound of cannabis. If you have any concerns, please consult with a medical professional prior to purchasing our products.</li>
														</ol>
														<h3>How do I know how much to take or which strength to buy?</h3>
														<ol>
															<li style="padding-left: 30px;">There is not a standard dosage amount for CBD products. Everyone&#8217;s sensitivity to CBD varies, so we recommend that you start out low and adjust accordingly. Cannabidiol and other cannabinoids are known to be non-toxic, with no known fatal overdose levels ever reported.</li>
															<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Please refer to this chart to help give you an idea of what concentration you may need.&nbsp; If you&#8217;d like to speak with us regarding your unique situation, please contact our Customer Service Team at customerservice@purehempbotanicals.com / 1-844-443-6764. Please keep in mind that our customer service representatives are not medical professionals.</li>

														<h3>What are cannabinoids?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cannabinoids are the primary chemical compounds produced by the cannabis and hemp plant.&nbsp;Of the non-psychoactive cannabinoids,&nbsp;Cannabidiol (CBD) is the most widely known.</p>
														<h3>Can CBD products be used with my prescription medications?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">CBD or hemp is a natural plant based supplement that does not generally have adverse reactions with prescription drugs. However, you should always consult with your health care physician before making any medical decisions.</p>
														<h3>Do I need a doctor&#8217;s prescription or medical marijuana card to purchase your products?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No, our products are classified as hemp so you are not required to have a prescription or medical marijuana card to purchase at this time.</p>
														<h3>What is CBD distillate and isolate?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Distillate is a full spectrum, highly refined extracted oil that can be refined further. Full spectrum means that the product can contain both THC and CBD. CBD Isolate results from highly concentrated, purified CBD.</p>

														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We utilize Ethanol Extraction and other post-processing methods such as winterization and distillation to further refine and purify our oil.</p>

														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We clearly define all our products by the amount of CBD in the total product.</p>
														<h3>Are your products THC Free?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our products are manufactured using hemp extract, defined by the Colorado Department of Agriculture as &#8220;a plant of the genus Cannabis and any part of the plant, whether growing or not, containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of no more than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) on a dry weight basis.&#8221; In simple terms, all our products may contain up to 0.3% THC. The THC amount in milligrams will vary depending on product suggested dosage.</p>
														<h3>How can I see the Lab Results for the product that I own?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We provide a Certificates of Analysis (CoA), the lab results, for all our products and upload them for everyone to view.

														<h3>Can I refill my cartridge once the oil has been used up?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes, our cartridges are refillable, however we cannot guarantee compatibility with the product you choose to refill it with. You can unscrew the mouth piece from the cartridge to refill it. Do not put the oil in the metal center piece of the glass covered cartridge or the cartridge will become unusable.</p>
														<h3>Can I use my own battery with the PHB vape cartridges?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our cartridges are compatible with 510 threaded batteries although we cannot guarantee effective compatibility.</p>
														<h3>Is distillate or isolate used in the formulation of the vape cartridges?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We use a combination of both distillate and isolate for our vape cartridges.</p>
														<h3>What are Glycols used in the vape cartridges?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Palm-based Propylene Glycol (PG) is used to formulate our vape cartridges.</p>
														<h3>How do I use a vape kit?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Vape Kit comes with one battery, one USB charger and one pre-filled cartridge with the flavor of your choice. Take the protective plastic cover off the bottom of the pre-filled cartridge. Screw the cartridge onto the battery. Press the button (located on the side of the battery base) 5 times, quickly and consecutively, to turn the battery on and off (this is indicated by blinking colorful lights). Hold down the button as you inhale and then let go of the button when you stop inhaling. To charge the battery, unscrew the cartridge from the battery. Ensure it is turned off by clicking the push button 5 times, quickly. Note: If you press the battery button once and it lights up around the push button, the battery is still on. Once the battery is turned off, screw the battery onto the USB charger and insert into a USB charging port. Once the light on the USB charger turns green the battery is full and ready for use.</p>

														<h3>Can you vape this product by itself?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do not recommend vaping this product on its own. The vape juice additive is for people who love to vape other products but would like to add or maximize the CBD benefits to their current vape liquids. You can add this product to any e-liquid or vape oil of your choice.</p>
														<h3>Why is the bottle not full?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We utilize a 5ml bottle for both the 1,000mg and 2,000mg vape juice. Both bottles are filled at approximately 3.75ml level. To keep a high concentration of CBD in this additive, we do not use any additional filler solutions which would defeat the purpose of having a low volume/high strength product to add to existing vape products without impacting their characteristics.</p>

														<h3>What are Isolated Spectrum Tincture Products?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our Isolated Spectrum Products are manufactured with purified isolated CBD. The isolate tincture features non-detectable levels of THC, meaning that THC compounds are not found with our instrumentation during our testing process.</p>
														<h3>Is there a difference in the formula for the human and the pet tincture?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no difference in the formulas for the tincture. Our tinctures are all safe for animal and human use. The label &#8220;Pet Tincture&#8221; is mostly used to inform our customers that the tincture can be used on their pets.</p>
														<h3>Can you vape the tincture oil?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No, we do not recommend vaping the tincture oil. The tincture is not formulated for vaping.</p>
														<h3>Why are your tinctures flavorless?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our company is vegan, so anything we use, from growing the plants, extracting the oil to manufacturing, must fall along those guidelines. Our oil is richly refined to avoid leaving a bad after taste.. The tincture is also formulated with organic and refined hemp seed oil and coconut oil, so any taste will come from these ingredients.</p>
														<h3>Why is there Hemp Seed Oil in the tincture formula?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Organic hemp seed oil acts as a carrier fluid. CBD is fat soluble and needs a fat source to extract and maximize the CBD content.</p>

														<h3>How do you use this product?</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The most common way to use the Frost Concentrate is to “dab” it. You will need to apply heat to a dabbing device, similar to a glass water pipe after applying the frost, which turns into a vapor and inhale. You can also place the product under your tongue or mix it with other ingredients to bake or cook food.</p>

														<h3>Hemp and Marijuana are not created equal.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a lot of confusion about the difference between hemp and marijuana since the two plants look identical. Though they are both varieties of cannabis, they are not the same. Hemp belongs to the species <a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/industry-markets-and-trade/statistics-and-market-information/by-product-sector/crops/pulses-and-special-crops-canadian-industry/industrial-hemp/?id=1174595656066" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cannabis sativa L</em></a> and it contains 0.3% or less of the psychoactive compound delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In contrast, marijuana plants contain 5% to 20% of THC. Another difference is that hemp plants usually contain significantly more cannabidiol (CBD) which is a compound that actually counteracts the psychoactivity of THC and has significant medical benefits.</p>
														<h3>You cannot get high from smoking or ingesting hemp.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hemp does not contain enough THC to produce any psychoactive effects. As Dr. David P. West explains in his article <a href="http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/content/hemp.mj.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hemp and Marijuana: Myths &amp; Realities</a> on the North American Industrial Hemp Council’s website, the trace amounts of THC in hemp are blocked by the high percentage of cannabidiol (CBD) in it. If you smoked hemp, you wouldn’t get a buzz.</p>
														<h3>Buying hemp products is legal in the U.S. in all 50 states.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hemp oil, dietary hempseeds, and other hemp products are legal in all 50 states but it is not legal to grow hemp in most states. Even though marijuana and hemp are two different plants, the federal government considers <em>all</em> cannabis plants a <a href="../4-reasons-why-hemp-should-not-be-considered-a-schedule-1-substance/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Schedule 1 Substance</a>. According to <a href="http://www.votehemp.com/legislation.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vote Hemp</a>, only fifteen states— Colorado, California, Oregon, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah, Kentucky, Indiana, South Carolina, Delaware, Vermont, Maine, West Virginia and Hawaii—allow industrial hemp farming for commercial purposes and/or research.&nbsp;This might change if the government passes the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015. If you think that it should be legal to grow hemp in all 50 states, please let your senators and congressmen know by signing <a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-take-action-to-support-u-s-farmer-and-consumer-rights?just_created=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our petition on Change.org</a>.</p>
														<h3>Cannabidiol (CBD) is found in hemp</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hemp contains at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">85 chemicals</a> called cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are a class of diverse&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compounds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chemical compounds</a>&nbsp;that act on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cannabinoid receptors</a>&nbsp;in cells that repress&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">neurotransmitter release</a>&nbsp;in the brain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)%20Cannabidiol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cannabidiol</a> is one of those chemicals. It has been linked to pain relief and reduced inflammation as noted in <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq/#section/_7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this report</a> from the National Cancer Institute. According to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbdv.200790147/abstract;jsessionid=255095E4D75EC1678EB2B5A01B3ADCCA.f02t04CBD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;Cannabidiol-Recent Advances,&#8221;</a> a scientific research article published in Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity in 2007, it appears to relieve nausea, anxiety, inflammation and convulsion. It is an active ingredient in <a href="../product/pure-hemp-capsules/index.html">hemp capsules</a>, hemp oil and many other health products made with hempseed oil.</p>
														<h3>Hemp can be used to make more than 25,000 different kinds of environmentally friendly products from health foods and beauty products to paper supplies and even <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/02/03/hempcrete-worlds-strongest-building-material/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">building materials</a>.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1938, the magazine <em>Popular Mechanics</em> called hemp the <a href="http://hemphistoryweek.com/hemp-history/hemp-history-timeline/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“New Billion Dollar Crop”</a> because researchers had discovered that hemp could be used to manufactory over 25,000 different kinds of products “from cellophane to dynamite.” With our technological advances today we are constantly discovering even more ways to use this incredibly versatile plant.</p>
														<h3>Eating hemp can be great for your health.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hemp seeds and hemp oil are rich in magnesium, iron, and vitamin E along with the healthy fats omega-3 and omega-6. (If you want the full skinny on hemps nutritional value, check it out on <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/custom/629104/2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Self Nutrition Data</a>). Hemp is also a complete protein which makes it a great plant-based protein source for vegans and vegetarians. Many people enjoy eating hemp seeds in salads, yogurt, cereals, granola and smoothies. Though hemp oil should not be used for high-heat cooking, it can be used in the kitchen too. (It makes a great salad dressing!) You can also find delicious substitute dairy products made from hemp and hemp protein powders.</p>
														<h3>Clinical and scientific researchers have discovered that CBD is a potential treatment for a wide range of conditions.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hemp has been used in medicine for thousands of years but the scientific community has only begun to extensively research it over the last few decades. Through their research, they have learned that CBD is the compound in hemp that is primarily responsible for its medicinal benefits. According to the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#section/_7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Cancer Institute</a>, CBD is thought to have significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity without the psychoactive effect (high) of THC. Project CBD houses links to an extensive collection of clinical and scientific studies that name CBD as a possible treatment for more than 20 different medical conditions including arthritis, acne, alcoholism, chronic pain, diabetes, depression, epilepsy, MS, PTSD, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders.</p>
														<h3>Hemp farming and production is great for the environment.</h3>
														<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are few crops that are as environmentally friendly as hemp. According to <a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/industry-markets-and-trade/statistics-and-market-information/by-product-sector/crops/pulses-and-special-crops-canadian-industry/industrial-hemp/?id=1174595656066" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canada’s Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food</a>, hemp matures in just 3 to 4 months and absorbs carbon dioxide 5 times more efficiently than trees. Unlike <a href="http://hempcouture.ca/inconvenient.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cotton</a> which requires lots of water and heavy use of chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides; hemp can be grown organically without the use of chemicals or toxins and without the need for excessive water. It is also great for the environment because it returns nitrogen and nutrients to soil. Hemp’s long roots actual aerate soil and help to prevent both soil erosion and mudslides. Another benefit for farmers is that it can thrive in almost any climate and any type of soil. It is no wonder that the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-fine-hemp-marijuana-legalize-20140626-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">L.A. Times’ tip to American farmers is to grow hemp</a>.</p>
