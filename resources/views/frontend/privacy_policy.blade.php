              <p>The 13 Pastures website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>

This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
