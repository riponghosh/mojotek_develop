              <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
              <p>Like most website operators, Pure Hemp Botanicals collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pure Hemp Botanicals' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pure Hemp Botanicals' visitors use its website. From time to time, Pure Hemp Botanicals may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
              <p>Pure Hemp Botanicals also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on purehempbotanicals.com blogs/sites. Pure Hemp Botanicals only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
              <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
              <p>Certain visitors to Pure Hemp Botanicals' websites choose to interact with Pure Hemp Botanicals in ways that require Pure Hemp Botanicals to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pure Hemp Botanicals gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a href="../index.html">purehempbotanicals.com</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Pure Hemp Botanicals are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Pure Hemp Botanicals collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Pure Hemp Botanicals. Pure Hemp Botanicals does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
              <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Pure Hemp Botanicals discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Pure Hemp Botanicals believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Pure Hemp Botanicals, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Pure Hemp Botanicals website and have supplied your email address, Pure Hemp Botanicals may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Pure Hemp Botanicals and our products.
