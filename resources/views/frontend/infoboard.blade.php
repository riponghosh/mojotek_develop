Think about what makes Sweetkandi special for you.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">The chance to talk to any member directly?<br />
The fact that you can make money selling what you don’t wear anymore?<br />
Or the features that help you find and buy exactly what you need?</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">What makes Sweetkandi special for us is our community of nearly 20 million people in 10 countries. We’ve come a long way since starting in 2008. Much of what you find on Sweetkandi today was created with your feedback.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">So we’re giving Sweetkandi a cleaner look to reflect all of you better. You’ll notice our whole look is a little cleaner to make our members’ listings stand out. The number one change, however, is our logo.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">It’s now handwritten to represent the personal touch present throughout our community:</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">💌 a thank you note you add to an item as you send it off<br />
✍ one-on-one communication with other members<br />
💗 as well as the connections and new friendships that form on Sweetkandi every day</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">Take a look around - it’s still the Sweetkandi you’re used to, with a few design improvements.

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">Untracked postage will no longer be insured by Sweetkandi. However, if something goes wrong, you may still be able to claim a refund from Royal Mail, so be sure to keep your postage receipt.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">The service fee that buyers are charged when they make a purchase will change to 3-8% of the item’s price + a fixed fee of £0.3-0.8. Previously, it was 4-8% + £0.6. You’ll always see the full service fee for your purchase before completing it.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">No more payout fees. You will be able to send any amount of money from your Sweetkandi Balance to your bank account free of charge. Now, you’ll keep 100% of what you make!</p>

    <p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">Item bumps are a feature that lets you <strong>sell faster by boosting the visibility of your listings</strong>. It also opens up special statistics. After you bump, you’ll see how many members viewed or took an action with your listing.<br />
<br />
Our latest improvement makes sure you can <strong>pay for bumps using a way that’s most convenient for you</strong>: PayPal, your credit card, or using the balance in your Wallet. Meaning: there’s no need to set up your Wallet if you don’t want to!<br />
<br />
When you purchase a bump for your listing, it will be sent to the top of the Sweetkandi feed and catalog once a day, for 3 consecutive days. This ensures more buyers will be able to see what you’re selling - even in search results.<br />
<br />
Give the items you want to sell an additional boost with either a <strong>3-day bump for ‎£0.95</strong>, that gets your item <strong>up to 5 times more visibility</strong>.<br />

    <p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">We at Sweetkandi would like to share with you some upcoming changes to our team’s communication with all you members. There are some important changes coming to Sweetkandi:</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">1. From now on, all official information and announcements about new features will be posted on our brand new Infoboard (About Sweetkandi >> Infoboard). This will help you find all important Sweetkandi news quickly and easily. The latest announcements will always appear at the top, and you’ll find the older ones in the archive. You’ll be able to give us a lot more constructive feedback, right from Infoboard, by clicking a button and taking a quick survey.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">2. Our <a href="help.html">Help Center</a> will become your first point of contact for questions. We aim to improve and update it every day - it already contains answers to questions that you face most often. In cases where you can’t find the information you need, or face a specific issue, we’ll always make sure you’ll find the “Contact support“ button to get help from our team.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">3. Lastly, there will be a change in the forum. The Sweetkandi team will no longer be answering your questions in the forum from November 5 2016. We know how important the forum is for you, and it will remain a platform for member-to-member communication - but the forum will change place. From November 5, the forum box that contains the newest topics will be removed from Sweetkandi’s feed, as we won’t be posting updates there any longer. You’ll find every forum topic under Browse >> Community.</p>

<p class="new-about__paragraph payments-explanation__paragraph">These changes are to help make Sweetkandi more efficient, and our top management are certain they will benefit our whole community. Don’t worry – you’ll never miss important information. It will just be delivered in a different and hopefully more efficient way!</p>
