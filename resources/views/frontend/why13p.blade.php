              <p>We think you’ll find that with our company, we do things a bit differently. Rather than put our efforts into bringing stronger levels of CBD to the market, we believe it’s more beneficial (and cost effective) for patients to start with lower dosages and develop a daily base that can be maintained for longer periods, rather than short term saturation. Then use CBD isolates as a supplement when needed.<br>

              Patients dealing with mild pain, anxiety, or depression, or those taking as a daily supplement for general well being will benefit more from lower dosages with longer maintained doses. This is where we focus our efforts. <br>

              What’s more, 13 Pastures is one of the few companies that can customize CBD blends, down to the carrier oil. So if your customers are asking for a specific cannabidiol compound, we can easily formulate it. <br>

              Here are a few more reasons why we are the best choice for your Cannabidiol needs:<br>
