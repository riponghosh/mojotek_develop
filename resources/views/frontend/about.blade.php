              <p>My start with Hemp oil was in 2017. I have a family member who suffers from arthritis in the knees. I heard about CBD oil and after a little research, I asked him to give it a try as a test. Almost immediately his pain level decreased and after a few days, he no longer needed a pain pill in the mornings! Needless to say, I became a believer!
              </p>
              <p>The more learned about Hemp Oil, the more I was (and still am) convinced that Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of nature’s miracles! </p>
              <p>From anxiety, depression, and chronic pain to overcoming opiate addiction and so much in between, Cannabidiol (CBD) is proving itself over and over as a natural pain reliever and natural healer.
              </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Cannabidiol (CBD) oil continues to be put in the same class as marijuana. As a result, many people suffering know little about the benefits of CBD and are missing out on it’s medicinal effects.  13 Pastures hopes to change that through education and patient success stories.
              </p>
              <p>I am truly passionate about working with CBD oil and look forward to the many positive changes coming to this industry.  Because of this passion and my belief in Cannabidiol (CBD) as a healing agent, our company only works with Grade-A, U.S. grown ‘industrial’ hemp and full flower cannabis plants. </p>
